**Abstract**
Air temperature, ground temperature and relative humidity data were collected in a longitudinal transect of the Nooksack watershed at varying elevations from 500 to 1800 m above sea level. Data were collected by anchoring sensors from trees above winter snow levels and shaded from direct solar radiation. Paired sensors were also buried 3 cm under ground near each air temperature sensor to determine snow absence or presence. Select sites included relative humidity sensors to indicate whether precipitation was occurring. Data were collected every 3-4 h from December 2015 to Sept 2018 (with ongoing collection). Code for analysis of daily mean, minimum, maximum, and temperature change with elevation (lapse rates) are available on Github (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3239539). The sensor download and intermediate data products are available on HydroShare at (http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/222e832d3df24dea9bae9bbeb6f4219d) with publicly accessible visualization available from the Nooksack Observatory at data.cuahsi.org. Hydrologic models are generally structured with a single annual average lapse rate parameter which assumes a linear temperature gradient with elevation. The daily data (2016-2018) is used as part of ongoing studies on the non-linear dynamics and temporal variability of temperature with elevation to improve assessments of watershed function and salmon habitat.

**Value of the Data**

• The air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and temperature lapse rate (TLR) data in this collection is the first dataset of this kind available at this location for calibrating and validating downscaled hydrological models in the glaciated North Fork Nooksack River watershed, which drains into Whatcom County, Washington State.

• This dataset can be used to more accurately model snow covered area (SCA), snow depth (SD), and snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Nooksack River watershed.

• The Nooksack Observatory serves as a prototype for developing collaboratively supported microclimatology networks.

• This dataset can be downloaded from the CUAHSI HydroClient and Hydroshare for water and atmospheric research in a range of disciplines in need of microclimatology observations and networks, including mountain hydrology, snow accumulation and melt dynamics, climatology, water resources management, drought and fire forecasts, and mountain ecology.

**Land Acknowledgement:**
The Coast Salish people are the indigenous inhabitants of Western Washington. The Nooksack Watershed, from the peak of Mount Baker to the Bellingham Bay, is the unceded ancestral land of the Nooksack Tribe and Lummi Nation. They are still here, continuing to honor and bring to light their ancient heritage. The University of Washington acknowledges the Coast Salish peoples of this land, the land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip and Muckleshoot nations.
